## Getting Started

I included this repository for my growing collection of links and resources that I've accumulated. My bookmarks folder is overflowing with links and articles, so I figured I'd give it some structure and slap it on GitHub.

For the algorithms, I'll keep adding them, but solutions are on the "Solutions" branch.
